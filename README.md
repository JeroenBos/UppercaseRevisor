### UppercaseRevisor

When typing in camelCase, I often mistime the pressing and releasing of the shift key, leading to words like *cameLCase* or *camelCAse* or just *camelcase*. To correct that, I write this tool, which in its essence replaces the character that is most likely in the wrong case.

You'd say Intellisense would be suitable for that, but because of [this bug](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/807273/microsoft-alm-shared-remoting-remotecontainer-high-cpu) I usually already have typed the word and escaped the context in which Intellisense could pop up to correct for that. My [other workaround](https://github.com/JeroenBos/Workaround.ALM.RemoteContainer) just mitigates the effect of that bug.

On top of that, having this functionality outside of Visual Studio is also pleasant.
